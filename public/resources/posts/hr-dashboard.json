    "The HR Dashboard is a clean, multi-page dashboard built with Vue and Chart.js — designed specifically for developers who want to move fast with minimal setup.",
    "What sets this one apart is that it's API-ready from the start. It comes with a pre-structured `/data` folder and simulated API calls throughout the dashboard. This means you can easily swap out those calls for your real database endpoints, delete the mock data, and you’re live.",
    "It’s perfect for internal HR tools or production apps that track headcount, employee performance, satisfaction, and more. The layout is clean, the components are flexible, and everything’s wired up to work — you just need to plug in your data.",
    "Whether you're prototyping or productionizing, this dashboard will save you serious time."
