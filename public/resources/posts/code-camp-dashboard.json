It's powered by ApexCharts, giving it rich, interactive charts right out of the box — perfect for tracking user progress, engagement stats, or course metrics.",
    "Whether you're launching a bootcamp platform, building an LMS, or just want a modern dashboard UI that looks sharp in dark mode, this template is a great starting point. And like all our dashboards, it's fully customizable — swap in your own data, change the theme, or repurpose it for a completely different use case.",
